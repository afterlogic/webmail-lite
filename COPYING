YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD,
INSTALL OR USE AFTERLOGIC'S PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION 
(THE "LICENSED SOFTWARE") DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE TRADEMARK OF MAILBEE AND/OR
AFTERLOGIC. BY INSTALLING OR USING THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, AND ITS TERMS SHALL BE BINDING WITH RESPECT
TO YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING
TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

2. DEFINITIONS.
When used in this Agreement, "AfterLogic" means AfterLogic Corporation, located
in Newark, DE, USA, and the words "You" and "Your" mean the party purchasing
a license to use the Licensed Software under the terms of this agreement. 

"Licensed Software" means compiled Objects, Modules, License Key and any and all
updates thereto, together with all associated documentation provided
by AfterLogic or its authorized resellers. Licensed Software also means
uncompiled source code if such source code is provided to You by AfterLogic. 

"License Key" means a unique code provided by AfterLogic or its authorized
resellers which identifies You, as well as the license type, and which
unlocks or enables certain features of the Licensed Software. 

"Application" or "Your Application" means a software application that
You develop which incorporates all or parts of the Licensed Software. 

"Evaluation Trial Period" means a specified period of time during which
You may temporarily use the Licensed Software for evaluation purposes only. 

3. LICENSE GRANT.
The Cumulative License granted to You by AfterLogic is a combination of the Base
License Grant, described in section (3A) below, which is common to every
Licensed Software title covered by this agreement, and one or more
supplemental License Grant which covers the specific product obtained by You
from AfterLogic or its authorized resellers. Four basic types of supplemental
License Grants are described in sections (3B) through (3E): Evaluation License,
Developer License, Computer License, Hosting Provider License. These four
basic types are hereby further defined and/or restricted as to the number of
developers, servers, locations and distribution method(s), depending on
the specific product(s) being licensed by You. The precise combination of
the Base License Grant and one or more supplemental License Grant(s) obtained
by You is identified by AfterLogic at the time of purchase or
most recent upgrade.

3A. BASE LICENSE GRANT.
In consideration of Your payment of applicable license fees and/or Your
acceptance of the terms of this Agreement, AfterLogic hereby grants to You
certain nonexclusive and nontransferable rights limited by the terms
of this Agreement. The Licensed Software is licensed (not sold) to You,
for use strictly under the terms of this Agreement, and AfterLogic
reserves all rights not expressly granted to You herein. If You upgrade
the Licensed Software to a higher-numbered version thereof or
to a comparable AfterLogic product, this license is terminated and
Your rights shall be limited to the license associated with
the upgraded product or version.

3B. EVALUATION LICENSE.
In order to facilitate an efficient evaluation process of the Licensed Softwar
by developers, AfterLogic may, at its discretion, provide specially designed,
temporary License Key(s) that are encoded with an embedded expiration date.
The License granted in conjunction with such License Key(s)
is considered temporary, and multiple developers may use it for
the sole purpose of evaluating the Licensed Software during
a specific Evaluation Trial Period. Licensed Evaluation Trial Software
contains mechanisms that inhibit its ability to function at a later date.
It is Your responsibility to ensure that the Applications You create do not
contain Licensed Evaluation Trial Software and that their ability
to function at a later date is not inhibited or diminished.

3C. DEVELOPER LICENSE.
The following terms and conditions contained in this section (3C) apply
to You ONLY if at the time of original purchase or most recent upgrade,
the License granted to You by AfterLogic was defined
as "Single Developer License" or "Unlimited Developer License". 

You are hereby granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free license to integrate
the Licensed Software into Your Applications and to distribute such
Licensed Software in connection with said Applications, provided
that (a) said Applications do not in any way compete with
the Licensed Software or expose the functionality of the Licensed Software
through a programmable interface; (b) each of Your Applications
developed using Licensed Software is substantially larger, more complex,
and contains a significantly wider range of functions as compared to
the Licensed Software; (c) each of Your Applications developed using
Licensed Software is designed for end users rather than for developers
who would be able to build other software that would compete with the
Licensed Software, and (d) You do not permit further distribution of
the Licensed Software by Your end users. 

You may embed the License Keys in the Applications You distribute,
provided that the following conditions are met: (a) each such Application
must be marked with a prominent copyright notice bearing Your name as
declared by You during purchase of the License; (b) the License Key may
not be embedded in any such Application or distributed in any other manner
that makes the License Key visible to the end user, and (c) each such
Application must include the following comment in its source code
within close proximity to each copy of an embedded License Key:
"This application utilizes a licensed copy of AfterLogic software,
copyright (c) 2002-2011, which is the property of AfterLogic Corporation,
www.afterlogic.com. All rights are reserved by AfterLogic. Use of any objects
outside of the context of this application is a violation of United States
and international copyright laws and other applicable laws." 

For each License Key provided to You by AfterLogic, You are granted a
nonexclusive License to provide the Licensed Software and/or the License Key(s)
to the number of Your employee-developers as indicated by AfterLogic
and further explained below. Should the number of developers with access
to the Licensed Software and/or the License Key(s) ever exceed the
number indicated at the time of original purchase or most recent upgrade,
You agree to inform AfterLogic of such change and to upgrade Your License
accordingly by paying an upgrade fee to AfterLogic in a timely manner. 

"Single Developer License" means that only one individual developer
employed by You may be given access to the Licensed Software and/or
the License Key(s) for the sole purpose of developing and maintaining
Your Applications. For as long as this specific individual developer
is employed or engaged by You in any capacity whatsoever, no other
developer may be given access to the Licensed Software and/or
the License Key(s). Should said individual developer leave Your
employ and cease any professional association with You, a new
individual developer may then take his or her place and be given
access to the Licensed Software and/or the License Key(s). 

"Unlimited Developer License" means an unlimited number of developers
at one organization may be given access to the Licensed Software and/or
the License Key(s) for the sole purpose of developing and
maintaining Your Applications.
 
3D. COMPUTER LICENSE
The following terms and conditions contained in this section (3D)
apply to You ONLY if at the time of original purchase or most recent upgrade,
the License granted to You by AfterLogic was defined as
"Single Computer License" or "Unlimited Computer License". 

Important Note: Under the terms of the Computer License, distribution
of the Licensed Software or the related License Keys, in any
form whatsoever, is strictly prohibited. Furthermore, the Computer License
may NOT be extended by hosting providers to their hosting clients
and/or subscribers. Hosting providers must select the Hosting Provider
License if any functionality of the Licensed Software is
to be made available, accessible or usable by their hosting clients
and/or subscribers. 

You may embed the License Keys in other Applications installed
on the same physical server(s) provided that the following conditions
are met: (a) each such Application must be marked with a prominent
copyright notice bearing Your name as declared by You during purchase
of the License; (b) the License Key may not be embedded in any such
Application or stored in any other manner that makes the License Key
visible to the end user, and (c) each such Application must include
the following comment in its source code within close proximity
to each copy of an embedded License Key: "This application utilizes
a licensed copy of AfterLogic software, copyright (c) 2002-2011,
which is the property of AfterLogic Corporation, www.afterlogic.com.
All rights are reserved by AfterLogic. Use of any objects outside of
the context of this application is a violation of United States and
international copyright laws and other applicable laws." 

"Single Computer License" means that You are granted a license
to install the Licensed Software on a single physical production server,
without limitation as to the number of central processing units
on the server, and on any number of development workstations and
servers which can only be used for testing and development purposes. 

"Unlimited Computer License" means that You are granted a license
to install the Licensed Software on any number of physical servers
maintained or owned by You, without limitation as to the number of
central processing units on each server.

3E. HOSTING PROVIDER LICENSE.
The following terms and conditions contained in this section (3E)
apply to You ONLY if at the time of original purchase or most
recent upgrade, the License granted to You by AfterLogic was
defined as "Hosting Provider License." 

Important Note: Under the terms of the Hosting Provider License,
distribution of the Licensed Software or the related License Keys,
in any form whatsoever, is strictly prohibited. 

You are hereby granted a nonexclusive license to install
the Licensed Software on multiple physical servers maintained
or owned by You, without limitation as to the number of central
processing units on each server. 

The License Key obtained by You as part of Your Hosting Provider
License may only be entered into the registry or config file of
the applicable physical server provided that the License Key
may not be stored in any manner that makes the License Key visible
to the end user. 

Installation of the Licensed Software on any server, accessible
to your hosting clients and/or subscribers, in any manner, which would
make it physically possible for Your hosting clients, subscribers,
or any other individual not directly employed by Your organization,
to potentially migrate, reinstall, transfer or copy the Licensed Software
to any other server whatsoever would be considered unauthorized
distribution and is expressly prohibited under this license. 

In case any of Your hosting clients and/or subscribers desires to gain
the type of access to the Licensed Software which may potentially
allow such client and/or subscriber to migrate, reinstall,
transfer or copy the Licensed Software to another server,
each such client and/or subscriber would be required to obtain
a separate software license from AfterLogic Corporation.

4. RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND TRANSFER.
You may not sublicense, rent, lease, assign or otherwise transfer
the Licensed Software or any of Your rights thereto, either in whole
or in part, to anyone else, except that You may, after obtaining
written permission from AfterLogic, permanently transfer

of the Licensed Software and the transferee agrees to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. Use of the Licensed Software
with a License Key obtained from a source other than AfterLogic
or its authorized resellers is expressly and strictly forbidden.
AfterLogic reserves the right to take any and all actions that
AfterLogic, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to protect against,
monitor and control the use of the Licensed Software with illegal License Keys.

the Licensed Software provided to You complies with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

of any hardware or any other equipment used with the Licensed Software
to function in accordance with applicable manufacturer's specifications
